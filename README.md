tallest buildings in New York City. This app uses the google maps api to create the map and place the markers
on the page where the buildings are, and also the Wikipedia api for images of the buildings. This app uses javascript promises to create a fetch requests, and has a sidebar filter to filter locations.

Use the sidebar search to filter locations. Click on a sidebar link to show the marker for that buildings location.
